**Project**: Coffee Shop Sales Analysis & Dashboard

This Excel project was meant to show my Ms-Excel skills and techniques typical used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze data in Excel. The project involves sales analysis and creating dynamic dashboard as visualization for purpose of better understanding and answering certain business questions for decision making.

## The Situation
Recently hired as Junior Data Analyst by a franchise owner at Maven Roaster, a coffee shop chain with three different in locations in New York City

## The Assignment
To better understand purchase behavior and streamline operations, you've collected transactional data from Jan-Jun 2023
### Your goal is to transform data into dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends and opportunities for the business.


OBJECTIVE 1. Data Preparation.

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the data. How many transactions were recorded, over what period of time? What products and product categories were sold?

Add a new column to calculate Revenue (price * quantity)

Add new columns to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date (display them as text (i.e. "Jan", "Feb*, "Sun*, "Mon"), instead of numeric values)

Add a new column to extract Hour from the transaction time


OBJECTIVE 2. Explore The Data With Pivot-Tables.

Insert a PivotTable on a new sheet to show revenue by month 

Add two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of week and by hour of day 

Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product category. sorted descending by transactions

Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions)


OBJECTIVE 3. Build A Dynamic Dashboard.

Add Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart

Assemble the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the PivotTable showing Top 15 product types (you can design your own layout, or follow the solution)

Add a slicer for store location, and connect it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet

Adjust formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard
